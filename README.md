# Student Services Application

## Description

I use GAPS for different tasks at work and over the years I've build a few mini appliations that have been useful un organizing data and saving some administrative time. With each year, I've updated the applications to encorporate new patterns or updated tooling and it is getting a bit difficult to remember which application has which new useful pattern or feature that I'd like to add to the next application.

With this in mind, I've realized that it would be helpful to have one application that makes use of as many of the patterns and processes in a centralized way. I'll try as much as possible to first build a new feature or use case with this repository and then extract the funtionality for the targeted application needed at work.

It may end up being an impractical Frankenstine app, but I think it will be fun to build and to see how far GAPS can be pushed in managing accounts for an organization with less than 1000 accounts.
